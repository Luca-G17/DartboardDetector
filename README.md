# Dartboard Detector

This project is a dartboard dectector written as part of a univeristy coursework. It implements a Hough transform for both ellipses as well as circles for detecting off-axis dartboards. A later revision of this project also utilised a generic polygon detector to locate the triangular shapes inside of the dartboard pattern
